## **Project: Diabetes Mellitus Prediction Using Machine Learning**  

### **Project Description**  
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an individual having **Diabetes Mellitus** based on medical data. The dataset contains various health-related features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, insulin levels, and BMI. The model can help in early diagnosis and prevention by identifying high-risk individuals.  

### **Features**  
✅ Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, feature selection)  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations 📊  
✅ Model training using different ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.) 🤖  
✅ Performance evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
✅ Deployment of the trained model using Flask or FastAPI 🚀  

### **Tech Stack**  
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)  
- Scikit-Learn (ML Models)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)  
- Flask/FastAPI (API Deployment)  

### **Installation & Usage**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-ml.git
   cd diabetes-prediction-ml
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the model training script:  
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```  
4. Start the API (if deployed):  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```  

### **Dataset**  
The dataset used for training is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).
